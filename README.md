Meditations.

Today is Thursday, 18th Dec 2025. I am writing this.
It's been almost 2 yrs into software industry. I have worked on python based AI wrappers in these 2 yrs in my current company, that i got placed right after college. The wrapper apps are react-typescript frontend / python-fastapi backend. 

When I got placed in my final year I was done with DSA then, so I wanted to start something new - some actual concept of machines. 
That was 2023. AI was blooming, Chatgpt is not hit its full bloom yet And the recession already hit hard. But amidst the chaos and pressure, me getting placement really relieved me a lot. I was terrified of not getting placed and going home with a jobless degree. That was what drove me to madly grind DSA for placements and temporarily/efficiently it worked. It got me placed. My branch is Mechanical engg. not even Computer Science engg. .Even if my branch was CSE i would not have studied the courses and at the end of the year I would have simply prepared for placements to get a job.

Back to me wanting to start learning something other than DSA. AI/ML was the new miraculous subject, everyone hailed it as world changing thing. So naturally I got motivated and looked into it. Learn from basics : loss functions, Neural networks etc... from andrew ng's coursera ml & dl specialisations. They were very informing about the basics that made today llms. I still feel good that I learnt them, because they are bare basics that still help me going or help me catch onto some new ai concepts.

Now, to my job. In the intial few months I transformed data into to good to model data using pandas, that data used to go into the model. Then in the world as the AI advanced the projects in my company also started to build AI wrappers. Then I got into actual development work of apps (ai wrapper apps). 

It may sound abnormal, but this is the truth. Even though I worked for 2yrs, finished many tasks in my team/projects. I don't know anythinig.

I don't have a clue about what actually happening and how things are working, not only under the hood and even above the hood (-_-) 
One year into my job 2024 ending, AI tools came in Chatgpt, AI IDEs. All I was doing was understanding my backend codebase fully & frontend codebase partially (I don't know anything about fronted). Understand the task at hand, Understand the framework, then prompt ai what to do ? also getting idea from ai on how to do and then doing the task - some manually - some ai. Task done. Rinse, Repeat. That's all.

Never actually learned anything, only solved the contemporary problem with resources at hand.
Now I am grinding DSA again to shift for a better package(money), but I feel hollow. Even though If i succeed at getting a higher pay, It is so obvious that I will be doing the same thing. Based on the situation i might learn things that are required to solve the problem at hand, but at the end of the day there is no real expertise. Only hollowness. And on every problem I tackle I almost can never have utmost confidence because there is no real expertise. So, this is basically hollowness that completes tasks which fullfills a business requirement without any actual learning.

From frameworks to AI all levels of abstractions and working with them has really made me feel more hollow.
So I have decided. Yes! In the age of vibe coding, I have decided to learn the core principles - The FUNDAMENTALS.
So before working on anyother app, I will first creat my own http server from scratch and first understand how requests come and go.

Currently I am learning DSA & System Design. Even though DSA is just math crap that needed to be studied for interviews, System design is actually about software engg. (building things, that too at Scale!, the apps that we use everyday. Actual building.Real software engineering.)

That knowleddge will be paired up the basics that I learn. I literally don't care if my job shift to a higher package delays. I can't / won't / don't want to feel hollow anymore. I want real expertise.

So In my current horizon, Im seeing that system design + hardcore fundamentals (whatever they are) will give me certain expertise. 
If life fucks and all my plans end up in trash, then also - so be it, but I am going to do things the basic fundamental principles way.
